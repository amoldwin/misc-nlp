<h>Star Trek Question Counter Tool</H>

The motivation for creating this script was the recent implication by CBS writers that one of the defining character traits of 
the Star Trek character Spock (originally played by Leonard Nimoy) is that he "asks a lot of questions." Seeking to determine whether this
true, I wrote a script to process all 79 Original Star Trek episodes and count the number of questions asked by each character. 
I found that Spock asks fewer questions than both Kirk and McCoy. Moreover, when we calculate his question count as a percentage of his total lines, he is less inquisitive than much of the main cast.
